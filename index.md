## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University focused on robotics and mechanical design. Through hands-on experience with the Cornell Cup Robotics team and competitive engineering projects, I have designed, fabricated, and tested modular mechanical systems using CAD, 3D printing, and rapid prototyping. I am particularly interested in building reliable, well-integrated systems that translate thoughtful design into real-world performance.
